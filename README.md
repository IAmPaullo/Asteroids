# Unity Roguelike Asteroids Game

## Summary
This game was initially created as a tech assignment. It was fun to develop and gave me several ideas, so I decided to continue its development.
[The last commit on the assignment was on Dec 4th](https://github.com/IAmPaullo/Asteroids/commit/fd347c6e6b1d2f9a1b34fc76a51bf2d96840559b).

## Future Plans
I haven't fully decided what it will become, but I have some ideas. I'm considering turning it into an Asteroid roguelike (lite?). The gameplay loop would be: Enter -> Progress -> Eventual Defeat -> Upgrade -> Return to the game.

I'm going pretty freestyle with this, but there are various challenges I want to impose on myself for this game.

## Timeline
I will not spend more than two months developing this. At the end of the deadline, I will wrap things up and see if I have something fun. Best case scenario = a game. Worst case scenario = learning experience.

## Technologies
I'm not entirely sure yet, but I want to test various concepts that I haven't been able to implement well due to lack of time/scope. This includes patterns, Unity technologies, plugins, tools, etc. Essentially, a playground for my own tools.

## Development Log
I will eventually add a log here to track everything that will be implemented and how much is left to finish. I'm currently reworking the whole UI/HUD and I've already reworked the player controls and input system.
I think it will be fun.
